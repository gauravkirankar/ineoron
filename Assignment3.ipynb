    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans = Functions in Python are advantageous because they allow for code reusability, modularity, and easier debugging. By encapsulating a specific functionality in a function, it can be called multiple times throughout a program, reducing the need to repeat the same code. Functions also allow for easy organization and separation of different parts of a program, making the code more readable and maintainable."
